        I’m sure you’ve heard the cliché before: 'Coding is hard.' Almost every senior developer 
        I know says this at least once when giving advice to a newbie on breaking into tech and 
        landing their first job. While there's a grain of truth in this cliché, I believe it's 95 percent false. </p>
        
        <h1 className=' text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2' >The Masses' why</h1>
        <p className='text-justify text-[18px]' >
        When I started some time ago, I was initially excited, knowing all the possibilities and superpowers
          I could unlock by enduring the challenge of learning difficult and mind-bending concepts that I was
          led to believe the computer understands. After a while, I realized the journey was getting rougher 
          and tougher by the day, and the concepts I had to learn to communicate with my computer were 
          becoming too demanding for my brain. Now, I was left in a dilemma—whether to persevere or take 
          the easier route and give up!
        
        Of course, I didn’t give up because I had watched some YouTube videos that charged me up and instilled 
        in me the mindset that I needed this skill to become who I wanted to be—a process I'm still undergoing. 
        This experience led me to think that coding is hard and that to improve, one must strain their brain and 
        delve into difficult concepts. However, after two years of tackling things the hard way, it's becoming easier.
        
        Learning React after JavaScript is much easier, and learning Next.js after understanding React.js is as easy 
        as saying 'PHP is…'—just to note. </p>
        
        <h1 className=' text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2' >The Truth</h1>
        <p className='text-justify text-[18px]' >
        The most naked truth about learning to code is that it's like 
        learning any other skill: get the basics right. Many people hear about coding's potential, how lucrative it is,
          and how it can give one superhuman abilities, so they decide to get into it at any cost. The problem isn't 
          learning it at all costs; it's not learning it correctly! They hear about a magic tutor who promises to help 
          them break into tech in two months—three weeks in extreme cases—and secure a job the following month, 
          so they enroll. After completing the course, they realize it was all a lie.</p>
        
        <h1 className=' text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2'>'What Do I Do' </h1> 
        <p className='text-justify text-[18px]' >
        I'll be very straightforward with this one: Learning to code is like building a structure—the foundation is crucial.
          If you want a better structure, you need to make the foundation stronger.

          Bonus: Tall buildings have very deep and firm foundations. If you want to go higher in anything, you need deep roots. 
          Depth will make you stand out.
        </span>

        Learning any new skill, like coding, may seem hard if the foundation isn't strong enough to accommodate advanced 
        concepts that follow basic ones. If you're learning how to code—any language, framework, or any other skill outside 
        tech—take your time to grasp the basics well, and you'll find coding to be at least 'not hard,' even if it's not easy.
